* Read Me
This repo contains run commands (or runcom) rc files.

- .bashrc
  + Note that you will need python installed and have bash version 4 or greater.
- .screenrc
  + Contains mostly customizations I've found useful, nothing ground breaking though.

** Installation
Since these are simple rc files, you can either copy/paste them or move them into your home directory to use.  Alternatively, you can symlink to the .bashrc and .screenrc files in this repo:
- $ cd $HOME
- $ ln -s /PATH-TO-THIS-REPO-CLONE/.bashrc .bashrc
